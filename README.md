Storyteller AI App - Documentation

Project Overview

The Storyteller AI App is designed to provide users with an immersive storytelling experience by generating personalized stories with accompanying visuals and audio. The application leverages the OpenAI API to create story responses and images based on user input. Once the story and visuals are generated, the app combines them into an MP4 video using a text-to-speech API to narrate the story. Users can save, delete, or share the final video directly from the app.

Key Features

📖 Story Generation: Users can input the type of story they want to hear, and the app will use OpenAI to create the story.
🎨 Image Creation: Along with the story, AI-generated images are created to visualize key parts of the narrative.
🎥 Video Compilation: The app compiles the story text and images into a video file, with text-to-speech narration.
💾 User Actions: Once the video is created, users can save, delete, or share it.
Technologies Used

🤖 OpenAI API: For generating story content and images.
